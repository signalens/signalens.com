Our SignalSDR series, including the popular SignalSDR Pi, is approximately the size of a credit card or Raspberry Pi, making it an ideal choice for both professionals and hobbyists who demand portability without sacrificing performance.

SignalSDR Pi stands out as a versatile SDR platform, known for its broad compatibility with popular hardware like ADALM-PLUTO and its user-friendly design. It's perfect for those looking to dive into SDR projects, whether you're working on signal processing, spectrum analysis, or communication systems.

As we continue to innovate, we’re also excited to introduce the upcoming SignalSDR Pro, a next-generation SDR platform that’s compatible with advanced hardware like the USRP B210 and capable of emulating 5G signals. While the SignalSDR Pro is on the horizon, the SignalSDR Pi remains our flagship product, delivering cutting-edge technology in a compact form factor.

At Signalens, our mission is to empower the global SDR community with small yet powerful tools that inspire discovery and advance the future of wireless communication.
